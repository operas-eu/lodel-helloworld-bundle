# Lodel HelloWorld Bundle

The Lodel HelloWorld Bundle is a starter bundle designed to help developers quickly create custom extensions for the Lodel 2.0 platform. It provides the basic setup and features needed to implement new functionality, similar to plugin systems found in other CMS platforms. This allows for a quick and efficient way to extend Lodel with tailored features.

This bundle is being developed as part of the CRAFT-OA Project (üîó CRAFT-OA), funded by the European Union (HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01, Grant Agreement: 101094397). It serves as a working example to illustrate how Lodel 2.0 bundles can be structured, integrating core Symfony concepts such as services, events, forms, controllers, and translations.

üöß Work in Progress: This bundle is still under development and serves as a foundation for further extensions.
