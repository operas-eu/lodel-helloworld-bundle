# Example/Scenario Branches (feature/*)

To explore a specific branch, run the following command in your project directory for the corresponding feature:

    $ composer require lodel/hello-world-bundle:dev-feature/{name}

Each branch focuses on a specific feature or functionality, providing the necessary configurations and code adjustments. If you need to modify the base configuration, refer to the [Base Branch (main)](./../doc/main_branch.md), which provides the fundamental setup and configuration files that can be adjusted as needed.
