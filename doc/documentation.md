# Code Documentation

Ensure Doxygen is installed on your system. You can install it via:

    $ sudo apt-get install doxygen

Generate the documentation:

    $ doxygen Doxyfile

This will produce an HTML documentation in the ```docs/html/```.
You can open ```index.html``` in a web browser to view the documentation.

Whenever you make updates to the code, re-run the above steps to refresh the documentation.
